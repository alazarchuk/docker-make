# docker-make

This repository contains a set of shell scripts and GNU Makefiles to
drive a simple docker build workflow with a local docker-compose based
development environment and the ability to push containers to a remote
Docker registry (in this implementation, ECR).  It also contains an
(almost) unmodified blank Rails 5.1 application as created by the
default rails generator.
